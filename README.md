Hi Please note,


These files are for reference to be used with AI (I used Claude) to build you apps for your Spotify Car Thing / Deksthing applicication.  If something doesn't work perfect, don't be upset with me, please. Instead, work to build 
this to a better knowledge base.


Even if you aren't a ham, This documentation has been made to be used to build nearly any Spotify car thing app!

Requirements, 

-Watch DudeTested - (https://youtu.be/11c7C-oZdTI)
- Download Deskthing - https://deskthing.app/
- Get Car Thing
- Hack Car Thing with Terbium - https://terbium.app/

Enjoy and best of luck!
